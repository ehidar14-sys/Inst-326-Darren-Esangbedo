This week, I focused on expanding my digital presence to complement the physical business cards I’ve been distributing. I created a simple landing page that showcases my chatbot services, pitch, and contact info, this was essentially a digital extension of my card. I also started experimenting with different LinkedIn posts that highlight use cases for automation in small businesses, aiming to attract interest from potential clients. The AI helped me draft a few post templates and refine my messaging tone. I’m starting to see how combining offline and online branding can reinforce credibility and make it easier for leads to convert.
