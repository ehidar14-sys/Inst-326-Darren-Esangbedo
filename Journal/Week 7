In Week 7 for my AI journal I will be talking about how , I used AI to help me plan and build a basic beginner friendly website for my AI chatbot service. I asked for help choosing a layout as well as writing copy for the homepage ,and also organizing sections like pricing, contact, and testimonials. The AI I used gave me structure ideas and helped me write clear and consise content that I could plug into "Carrd" or "Notion". This made the process faster and helped me stay focused on what matters most which was converting visitors into potential clients.
