In Week 8, I shifted to branding and used AI to help me design business cards I can hand out to potential clients. I asked for the AI for some basic layout suggestions like taglines, and  also ways to highlight my chatbot services in a clean format. The AI helped me write a short pitch and choose what contact info to include. I now have a draft card I can print or use digitally when networking.
