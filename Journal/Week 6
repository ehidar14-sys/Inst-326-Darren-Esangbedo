For This weeks Ai Journal I used AI to help with a large object-oriented programming assignment in Python to help explain the definitions that we used for our classes for better understanding. 
I uploaded screenshots of 20 examples of stacks and got back a lengthy easy to understand explanation on how to properly go about the assignment ,
I also used AI to refine my chatbot service strategy by getting advice on pricing, positioning, and outreach for small business clients. 
For my team-based workshop for my INST 335 class,  I asked AI to generate a simple 8-week tracking template to help me and my team stay organized. Overall, AI helped me understand how to code faster,improve my business 
offer, and streamline team documentation for my other class.
