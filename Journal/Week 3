Week 3 Journal entry



I mostly used AI this week to help out with the composition and finalization of my tasks.  For instance, I requested that it shorten and make my responses more clearto case study 
discussion questions in order to make them more lucid and succinct.  For leadership feedback tasks, I also used it to reword comments in more formal language.  
I also had it create a first draft of an email to a professor, which I then edited to suit my style.  Overall, AI helped me reword my thoughts and save editing time, but I still
made sure my voice was heard in the finished product.
