# 🧠 AI Journal — Week of October 28, 2025

## 🔍 Debugging Help
This week I ran into a few bugs while working on encapsulation and property validation in Python. I used AI to help trace the issue with a class that wasn’t enforcing type constraints properly. The AI quickly spotted that I had forgotten to use a setter method and gave me a corrected version with `@property` and `@<property>.setter` decorators.

## 🧪 Test Case Generation
I asked the AI to generate assertion-based test cases for my class implementations. It provided clean, minimal examples that matched the expected behavior and helped me verify correctness without writing full unit tests. This was especially useful for validating edge cases like empty lists, zero values, and boolean flags.

## 📚 Study Planning
I used AI to help break down my upcoming workload for the week. I listed my assignments and asked it to suggest a study schedule. It gave me a simple plan that prioritized my most urgent tasks and helped me avoid last-minute cramming. I didn’t follow it perfectly, but it helped me stay on track.

## 🧵 Markdown Formatting
While preparing my journal entries for GitHub, I asked the AI to format my notes in Markdown. It gave me a clean layout with emojis, headings, and spacing that looked great in the rendered view. This saved me time and made my journal easier to read.
