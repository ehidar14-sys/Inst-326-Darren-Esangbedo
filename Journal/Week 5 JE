This week, I used AI to help me brainstorm business ideas that center around AI-powered models. I asked for examples of low-cost (*Because I am in college and money can be hard to come by from time to time) as well as scalable businesses that use automation chatbots, or data-driven tools. With using copilot that helped me explore options like selling chatbot templates, or offering AI-powered lead generation services, and building complex/niche tools for small businesses. It also helped me think through monetization strategies and how to position these services for different industries. This gave me a clearer direction for launching something practical and profitable with marginal startup costs.
