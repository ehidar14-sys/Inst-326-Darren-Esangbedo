# ðŸ§  AI Journal â€” Week of October 21, 2025

## ðŸ“˜ Assignment Support
This week I used AI to complete a series of object-oriented programming exercises for my course. I uploaded screenshots of each exercise and received clean, copy-paste-ready Python class implementations. The AI helped me stay focused and saved time by avoiding unnecessary explanations.

## ðŸ§  Concept Reinforcement
While working on encapsulation and data hiding, I asked the AI to clarify how to structure classes with validation logic. It provided concise examples using properties and helped me debug a few edge cases in my assignment. This was especially helpful for understanding how to enforce constraints without breaking encapsulation.

## ðŸ“Š Statistics Help
Earlier in the week, I used the AI to solve a probability problem involving spray paint coverage and normal distribution. It walked me through the calculation and gave me a clean formula to plug into my Jupyter notebook. That saved me from digging through lecture slides and helped me finish the problem set faster.

## ðŸ§ª Testing and Assertions
I appreciated how the AI included assertion-based test cases for each class implementation. This made it easy to verify correctness and gave me a better understanding of how to write simple unit tests.
