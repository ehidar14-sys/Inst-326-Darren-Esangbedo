After the Thanksgiving break, I focused on coming back with a clear head and new energy. The pause gave me time to reflect on my core priorities whether it was academically or professionally. I used part of the break to revisit my branding materials, tweaking my business card layout and refining the pitch I’ve been developing for outreach. I also started drafting ideas for a new LinkedIn post to reengage potential clients and showcase recent chatbot results.
In class, we resumed with more hands on work in statistics with R as well as final exam prep which aligned well with the data analysis I’ve been doing for small business automation. I found myself applying concepts from lecture directly to my client work, especially around interpreting variability and confidence intervals. It’s satisfying to see academic tools translate into real situations.
One highlight this week was revisiting the ethics workshop I’ve been building.  I also began sketching out a visual redesign for the presentation, using Canva to make it more interactive and polished.
Overall, Week 12 felt like a reset and a relaunch. I’m focused on finishing the semester strong while laying the groundwork for client acquisition and content creation over winter break
