This week, I finalized my business card design and started testing it in real-world scenarios. I printed a few copies and handed them out during campus events and casual meetups, i wanted to place an emphasis on how people responded to the layout and tagline. I also created a digital version for LinkedIn and my own email outreach. The AI-generated pitch continues to be useful it’s relatively  concise and helps me explain my chatbot services clearly. I’m beginning to see how consistent branding can make my offerings more memorable and professional. my next step is going to be exploring different ways to integrate testimonials or client results into my outreach materials.
