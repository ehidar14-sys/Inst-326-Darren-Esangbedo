Week 2 Journal entry


This week I used AI in several ways to support my work and learning. I asked ChatGPT to help me write R code for filtering
flight data based on conditions like delays, destinations, and airline carriers, which made testing and comparing different
scenarios easier. I also used it to learn more about the Student Community for Leadership and Advocacy (SCLA) honors 
society at UMD, which helped me evaluate whether it would be valuable to join. For one of my programming courses, 
I used AI to draft short reflection responses about what I should continue, stop, and start doing, which helped me 
write concise yet thoughtful answers. Finally, I relied on AI to draft professional emails to professors and teammates. 
This was especially useful for improving tone, making my writing more concise, and ensuring I didnâ€™t miss important details, 
though I always personalized the drafts before sending them. Overall, AI saved me time with brainstorming, writing, 
and communication tasks while still leaving me in control of the final output.
