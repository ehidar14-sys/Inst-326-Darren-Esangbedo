Week 1 Journal Entry

This week, I was introduced to the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and one of the biggest takeaways for me was realizing just how many different forms of AI exist and how unique each one is. Before this week, I thought of AI as a single concept, mainly associated with robots or virtual assistants like Siri. But as we started exploring the topic, I learned that AI comes in many different types and serves a wide range of purposes.

Some AIs are designed for specific tasks, like recommendation systems used by Netflix or Amazon, while others are more general and can interact with humans in natural language, like chatbots or virtual agents. There are also types of AI that focus on learning from data (machine learning), others that try to mimic how the human brain works (neural networks), and even AIs that can create content, like art or music.

What really stood out to me is how each type of AI has its own strengths, limitations, and areas where it's most useful. For example, an AI trained to recognize images might be great at identifying faces but completely useless when it comes to holding a conversation. This helped me understand that AI isn't one size fits all itâ€™s a broad and evolving field made up of many specialized branches.

Overall, Week 1 opened my eyes to the diversity within AI and set the foundation for what I hope will be a deeper understanding in the weeks to come.
